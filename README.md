About the Project

This is a redesigned and significantly improved version of my previous puzzle game — now built with scalability, modularity, and clean architecture in mind. The entire system was developed to make adding new mechanics and features as seamless and efficient as possible.

Key improvements include:

A modular structure that allows for easy expansion and maintainability.
A pooling system to avoid unnecessary memory allocation and prevent triggering the garbage collector.
Careful avoidance of inefficient methods like GetAllChildren, ensuring better runtime performance.
This version lays a solid foundation for future updates, new level designs, and gameplay features — all without sacrificing performance or code quality.
